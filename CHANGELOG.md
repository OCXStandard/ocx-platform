# Changelog

Workspace-level summary; each package keeps its own `CHANGELOG.md` under
`packages/` with the details.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `ocx-render`: colour by plate thickness (default) with a viewer legend
  that isolates a thickness; panel-grouped, searchable parts tree with
  show/hide and click-to-select in 3D; `--panel` filter; parallel plate
  tessellation (`--workers`); brackets rendered as solids.

### Fixed

- `ocx-geometry` / `ocx-render`: plates trimmed from multi-member panel
  charts no longer render as the whole panel side, as fragments or empty
  (mesh-trim side vote and bridging, LSCM chart stitching and faceting,
  holes that only touch a plate edge, plus an area guard as backstop).
- `ocx-render`: per-part failures are isolated and recorded instead of
  aborting the render; CutBy hole failures are reported separately from
  skipped parts; failing plates get complete diagnostics records.
- `ocx-diagnose`: skip tables include hole failures (see the package
  changelog).

### Dependencies

- certifi 2026.10.19, filelock 4.2.1, setuptools 84.1.0, virtualenv
  21.14.13 (lockfile).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-03

### Added

- HTML report renderer: `--format html` (auto-inferred from a `.html`
  destination), tabbed multi-section documents, in-document links from
  BOM groups and part rows to catalogue entries.
- New reports: `report panels`, `report plates`, `report stiffeners`,
  `report brackets`, `report pillars` — attributes, physical properties
  and unit-converted scantlings; geometry intentionally excluded.
  All included in `report all`.
- Compartments report: `Cargo type` column and a `Cargoes` table with
  cargo attributes and properties (density, carriage pressure, liquid
  state, stowage factor, permeability, angle of repose).
- Bill of material: groups are expandable rows with per-group totals
  (click-to-toggle in HTML; inline child rows in markdown/rich).
- Panel children (plates, stiffeners, pillars) inherit the panel
  `functionType`; inherited values shown in parentheses.
- IR: full `BracketParameters` on `IrBracket` (noses, free edge radius,
  reinforcement type, origin, U/V directions, `FeatureCope`,
  `FlangeEdgeReinforcement`); `IrPillar` trace, inclinations and
  penetrations.

### Changed

- Cross-section catalogue reports list unique bar sections only.
- BOM item rows show the part name (id as fallback) without the id.
- Group rows render in bold; missing values render as empty cells
  instead of `N/A`.
- `report bom --detailed` flag removed — superseded by expandable
  groups.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-01

### Removed (breaking)

- The `ocx_model_validator.sections` package (cross-section building, JSON
  document, 2DLX/HMX export, SVG plot, EPP splitting, section properties).
  This functionality now lives in the `nh-sections` package of the
  [nh-mcp](https://github.com/ocastrup/nh-mcp) project.
- `validator section create/export/plot` CLI commands.
- `build_cross_section` and `save_cross_section` MCP tools (the `ocx-mcp`
  server now exposes 5 tools).
- 2DLX/HMX schemas, sample section artefacts and related tests.
- Unused `numpy` runtime dependency and `xmlschema` dev dependency.

### Changed

- Generic helpers formerly in `sections/` relocated into core:
  - `ocx_model_validator.frame_table` — `FrameTable`, `build_frame_table`,
    `frame_table_block`.
  - `ocx_model_validator.model.units` — `to_si`, `qty_mm`, `qty_m3`,
    `qty_kpa`, `point_mm`.
  - `ocx_model_validator.reporting.generators._compartment_data` —
    `build_compartments_block` and curve-point sampling helpers.
- `ocx` dependency pinned to the final `>=3.2.0` release.
